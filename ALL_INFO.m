% This file contains information on all documnets.

% atam.topwords has the information taken from the the study my work is
% based off.
% It has in column one the tweet ID for, cloumn two has the tweets info on
% what it is, G is general, S is symptom, and T is treatment, column three
% has the actual tweet, and column 4 has the weight of the tweet.

% Calculating (1-6) are all my funtions used to determine the weight of the
% tweet.
% For my final project I used Calculating4.

% Cases was used to determine how many splits the descision tree should
% have, which was 6 splits, due to it having the highest success rate.

% DataGrapher was an earlier version of my project and is actually used for
% parts of Calculating.

% Exces data is a file used that I just used to help determine which
% Calculating to use, by comparing results.

% Graphing and it's following 1-All are plots of the data, that I used so I
% could see how the data was grapher and how the data should appear if it
% was all labeled correctly. 

% GraphingFinal wa used to compare the graphs of what they should be vs.
% what it came out with when using the descision tree.

% Labelstest and Labelstrain are the proper labels for my data.
% test is obviously what the labels for my 60 test examples and train is my
% labels for my 40 train examples.

% Project contians the final code for my project and descriptions of the
% files I used.

% Redoing used k neerest neighbor to classify points, which in the end was
% less correct than the others

% Testing, Testingagain, TestingIT, & TestingTesting123 are all files that
% I used to test out different parts of my project, so that I didn't have
% to do all at once and could test quickly.
% They were also used to get out the bugs in the code and errors.

% Tweets (1-6) were the spliting of my 100 tweets and their weights gotten
% from plugging them into their respective Calculating functions.
% Tweets4 is the Tweets weight I used for my final project, with
% Calculating4.

% TweetsTesting was also an extra testing file used to work out errors.

% Values files contain the tweets total word count and the tweets weight
% from the respective Tweets and Calculating files.
% This was placed into the descision tree function and determined and used
% to label the outcome of the tweets.
% The Valuestest and Valuestrain were the final values used with the
% project
